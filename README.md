neo keyboard layout
===================

## Inspired by [German keyboard layout: NEO](http://www.neo-layout.org/)

## Variations

- neo-extended dvpe (done)
- neo-extended dvp (done)
- neo-extended qwerty (done)

## How to?
- run the specific script, and that's all 
- if you want to make it permanent, add it to your `~/.xinitrc` or `~/.profile`
- and by the way, we need [xcape](https://github.com/alols/xcape), install that first.
