Icon from [Neo â€“ Keyboard Layout](http://neo-layout.org/index_en.html).

Go settings -- keyboard -- keyboard source input

Copy these two files into `/Users/zxtang/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.

Optionally, I will change the keyboard source name to "Dvorak", and install
"showyEdge" to indicating the input source your are using.
